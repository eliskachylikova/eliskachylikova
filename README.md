➡ If you use open source identity management tool **Keycloak**, check out extensions that I created as a part of my Bachelor thesis: [keycloak-extensions](https://github.com/eliskachylikova/keycloak-extensions), you can now find them also in [Awesome Keycloak GitHub](https://github.com/thomasdarimont/awesome-keycloak)
